#Rules of Engagement: High School Trainee Program

Do you plan to host a high school trainee? Because most high school trainees will be under the age of 18, there are several things that you will need to be cognizant of which fall outside the normal scope of a managing a contractor, intern, and/or regular full or part-time employee.

##Hiring Manager and Mentor Responsibilities:

1. “Trainee” (and not “Intern”)

⋅⋅* When speaking to your trainee, please remember not to refer to them as an “intern”. Trainees are not a part of LinkedIn’s official intern program; they won’t be able to attend any intern events, etc.

⋅⋅* Your trainee’s badge will have limited access into the building which they sit in (plus the nearest building with a cafeteria): Mon-Fri, 8am-8pm. So, if you want them to attend a meeting in another building or on another campus, please make arrangements for that.

2. Alcohol

⋅⋅* You will need to take additional measures to ensure the trainee is not exposed to alcohol. This would entail removal of all alcohol from the area where the trainee sits, including local micro kitchen.

⋅⋅* Should you host a team event onsite, you will need to make sure the trainee is not within range of accessible alcohol.

3. Working Hours

⋅⋅* Your trainee’s weekly hours will depend on their work permit. Trainees are eligible to be paid overtime, when applicable, but may not work more than 48 hours per week. You should make reasonable efforts to ensure the scope of work you give the trainee does not require more than 8 hours per day / 40 hours per week when school is not in session. You are responsible for knowing when your trainee returns to school. When school is in session, your trainee may not work more than 4 hours per day on any school day (or 8 hours per day on any non-school day..

⋅⋅* Please keep in mind the training program is intended to benefit the trainee rather than tomeet the labor needs of the business.

4. Events

⋅⋅* You will need to limit your trainee’s events to only be on-campus. The trainee will be excluded from all offsite events (this includes company sponsored events, intern social events, and group/team/org lunches or dinners).

⋅⋅* You will use your cost center to charge in any on-site events for your trainee.
