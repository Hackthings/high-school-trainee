# WIT High School Summer Trainee Bootcamp

LinkedIn’s Women In Tech is proud to present the new streamlined high school trainee summer bootcamp designed to prepare and encourage high school girls to enter STEM and computer science-related careers. This bootcamp lasts for 7 weeks (with an optional 8th week), and will introduce frontend and backend development.

## Mentor Expectations
Mentors should review lectures, labs, and lab solutions beforehand in order to effectively help the trainees with any questions they may have. It’s up to the mentor if they would like for their trainees to use the Git project to see lab directions and lab solutions, or if they want to withhold the lab solutions and only share the lab directions.

## What’s in the Git Repo
*Note: this curriculum was written to be used with either Mac or Windows 10 computers. We use Python 2.7 in the latter half of the curriculum, but all Python material covered are Python 3 compatible.*

1. Commands_Cheat_Sheet.docx contains basic UNIX, SVN, and Git commands. These commands are covered in the Terminal lecture and the optional Git/SVN lecture (pick the relevant slides based on what you use). You may want to consider printing out copies for the trainees to keep.
2. Lesson_Plan.docx has a high-level overview of each week’s topics.
3. The rest of the folders in the repo are each week’s lesson material. In each week’s folder, we’ll have lesson material for each day. Each day will have a corresponding lecture, lab, and lab solution. The filename convention is weekNumber.dayNumber_topic_title.pptx

## Bootcamp Structure
This bootcamp is designed with the expectation that trainees will be available for 4 days each week for 7-8 weeks. Each day is 8 hours long, with the expectation that 1 hour is for lecture and up to 3 hours are for lab. The remaining time in each day is for the trainees to spend working with their mentor.
